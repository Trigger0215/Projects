This project is try to replicate the website of `https://game.163.com`, and just need to choose 3 pages.

The most difficult thing I think is that the carousel of homepage. It's big and have a lot of small functions. So it takes lots of time.

And the second hard point I think is the BUFF page. I use data driven tec to make this page can change data and resource without backend data.

I think this tec is useful and the reason is that we don't need to do some operate with browser's elements. We only need to change or modify the data in the data Array, we don't need to handle render function any more.

All in all, this project is a chanllenge and a little bit hard. But I cam still make it. Try better next time!
